 	 	<h2 class="style" id="recruitment">Python Coding Challenge for RA Applicants</h2>
<!-- This challenge was adapted from the JHU Neuroplasticity and Development Lab -->
		<h3>Thank you for your interest in working with us!</h3>
			<p class="para_projects">
				In this challenge, you'll carry out some operations on mock numerical data. The operations you'll need to implement are similar to steps you might encounter in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis pipeline. You should use the Python programming language (with numpy, scipy, & matplotlib) to solve the problems. Please produce one script that generates all of the requested results figures. <u>While it is important that your script give accurate results, applicants will be assessed most strongly on the implementation</u> (e.g., well-thought out, well-commented, readable, organized). 
				<br><br>
				If you have any clarification questions <b>about the instructions</b>, please send them to sr1209@georgetown.edu. <b>We will not be able to answer any conceptual questions about the material (e.g., Python, image processing, fMRI, cognitive neuroscience)</b>. Therefore, we encourage you to make use of publicly available resources, such as Google, YouTube, online forum archives (e.g. Stack Overflow), and software documentation. Be sure to document with an in-line comment anytime a code snippet comes from an external resource. However, you should not directly recruit any external help, e.g. from friends or online help forums. This is meant to be a test of your own problem solving skills. 
				<br><br>
				You will have 1 week to complete as much of the test as you can. When you are finished, please upload your script + results figures as a .zip file named with the heuristic "LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME.zip" to the link below. The problems are intended to be challenging, and we do not necessarily expect you to complete all of the problems perfectly. <a href="example_output.zip" target="blank"> Feel free to view example outputs at this link</a>. Please comment your thought-process throughout the script. Good luck!
			</p>
			<h3>Section 1. Image Processing<br></h3>
			<p class="para_projects">In this section, you will read a grayscale JPEG image (<a href="otter.jpeg" target="_blank">please download otter.jpg here</a>) into Python as a numerical matrix and carry out some operations on it.
			<ol style="font-size: 14px">
				<li><b>Plot a histogram.</b> Plot a histogram of the image intensities in the JPEG. Include 10 histogram bins. Save the histogram plot as either a pdf or png file. (e.g., otter_hist.pdf)</li>
				<li><b>Scramble the image.</b> Shuffle the pixels in the image (without altering the values) and save the scrambled image as another JPEG. (e.g., otter_shuffled.jpg)</li>
				<li><b>Spatially smooth the image.</b> Smooth the image by convolving with a 2D Gaussian kernel. The kernel should have a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 10 pixels. Save the smoothed image as another JPEG. (e.g., otter_smoothed.jpg)</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
			<h3>Section 2. Simulate a BOLD time-course<br></h3>
			<p class="para_projects">In this section you will create a simulated blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) time-course. The time-course will be based on a predicted neural response, following an on-off stimulus presentation. The relationship between BOLD signal and neural firing is modeled as a linear time-invariant system. A hemodynamic response function (HRF) represents the predicted BOLD signal following a brief neural impulse. The predicted BOLD signal in response to a train of neural firing is obtained by convolving thetime-course of neural firing rates with the HRF. Here you will create such a BOLD time-course, starting with a neural firing time-course, and using a standard HRF (hrf.txt).
			<ol style="font-size: 14px">
				<li><b>Plot the HRF.</b> Read the HRF text file (<a href="hrf.txt" target="_blank">please download hrf.txt here</a>), which contains a column of small numbers, into Python as a numerical vector. Plot the HRF as a continuous line and save the figure as either a pdf or png file (e.g., hrf.pdf). Importantly, the HRF is in units of 2 secs. It contains 16 values, and so represents a time window of ~32 seconds. Notice the slow rise and fall of the HRF, which is one of the reasons for the lack of temporal precision in fMRI.</li>
				<li><b>Generate a predicted neural time-course.</b> Generate a predicted neural time-course based on an on-off stimulus presentation paradigm. The time-course should be 200 secs long, but have the same temporal units as the HRF (2 secs). Model the neural time-course as a "boxcar" function, with stimulus "on" periods taking a value of 1.0, and stimulus "off" periods taking a value of 0.0. On and off periods should be 20 secs long. Plot the predicted neural time-course and save as a pdf or png. (e.g., on_off.pdf)</li>
				<li><b>Convolve neural time-course with the HRF.</b> Convolve the simulated neural time-course with the HRF, and <u>plot them together (both 200 secs long)</u>. Save figure as a pdf or png. (e.g., on_off_convolved.pdf)</li>
			</ol></p>
			<p class="para_projects">Bonus:
			<ul style="font-size: 14px">
				<li><b>Add low frequency noise.</b> fMRI data is often plagued by low-frequency noise. Add low-frequency noise to your convolved BOLD time-course, in the form of a sine wave with a period of 300 secs, and amplitude 0.3. Plot and save a figure. (e.g., convolved_drift.pdf).</li>
				<li><b>Add white noise.</b> Finally, add random Gaussian noise at each time point (use sigma=.2). Plot and save a figure. (e.g., convolved_drift_noisy.pdf)</li>
			</ul>
